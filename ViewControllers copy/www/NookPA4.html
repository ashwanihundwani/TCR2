			<p>Some people with tinnitus feel like they can&rsquo;t enjoy life again unless the tinnitus is quieter or gone. Because of this, they may stop doing many of their usual activities, especially activities they enjoy. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>If you are doing fewer activities because of tinnitus, then you are more likely to be focused on your tinnitus, and you are more likely to feel unhappy. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>One way to start feeling better is to plan pleasant activities even when your tinnitus is bothering you. Pleasant activities can help you enjoy life and pay less attention to your tinnitus. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>At first, you might feel like you are &ldquo;relearning&rdquo; how to enjoy pleasant activities. The activities might be harder to enjoy than they were without tinnitus. With time, you can learn to enjoy the activities even with tinnitus. </p>

            <p><p> One way to increase pleasant activities is to plan ahead. This may sound simple, but most of the time we wait until we feel better to do something we enjoy. </font></p>

<p> If you let how you feel guide what you do, then you may end up staying home and not doing anything. If you schedule pleasant activities you will find it easier to do something you enjoy. As a result, you may feel more pleasure!</font></p>

            <p>Medications used for tinnitus were developed for other problems like depression, anxiety, and trouble sleeping. Some of these medications can improve your mood. A better mood can help to make tinnitus less of a problem. In rare cases medications may make tinnitus quieter. However, medications can also make tinnitus louder. Because of possible side effects, the use caution with medications.<br>

<b> Does my tinnitus make it harder for me to hear?</font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p> Many people have hearing problems along with tinnitus. Some people think hat the tinnitus causes their hearing problems  which is not true. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p> Hearing problems are caused by hearing loss or problems processing sound. If you have tinnitus or hearing problems, you should have a hearing test.</font></p>
