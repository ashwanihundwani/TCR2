                    <p>  In this section of the Learning Nook you will find instructions for the relaxation exercise Deep Breathing. You can either read these instructions, or watch a video. You can use this exercise anytime you feel stressed.

                        <br />
                        <p>                        Deep Breathing slows down your body, helps you to get your mind off of your tinnitus, and helps you feel relaxed and calm.  When you are calm you feel a sense of relief from tension and stress caused by tinnitus, think more clearly, function better, and feel better overall.

                    <p><i> Step 5 of 9:  </i></p>
                    <p> Close your eyes (if you are comfortable doing so) or look at an object in the room like a book on the bookshelf.  </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <br />
                    <p><i> Step 6 of 9:  </i></p>
                    <p> Take a deep breath in through your nose --slowly for a count of three. (Remember to use your stomach first and let your chest expand naturally after that.)  </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <br />
                    <p><i> Step 7 of 9:  </i></p>
                    <p> Hold that breath for two seconds and then exhale for a count of three from your mouth.  </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p><i> Step 8 of 9:  </i></p>
                    <p> Repeat steps 4 and 5 at least five times.  </p>

                    <p> When you are ready to stop the Deep Breathing exercise, count back from 3 to 1:
                      <br />
                        <br>3 - Become aware of your surroundings
                        <br>2 - Move your feet, legs, hands, arms, and rotate your head
                        <br>1 - Open your eyes feeling relaxed
                      </p>

                    <p><i> Step 1 of 9:  </i></p>
                    <p> Find a relaxing place where you will not be disturbed. If needed, turn your phone off and ask others to give you this time alone. Loosen any tight clothing or change into comfortable clothes.  </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <br />
                    <p><i> Step 2 of 9:  </i></p>
                    <p> Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor or propped up. Place your hands in your lap or on the arms of the chair. Make sure you are comfortable.   </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <br />
                    <p><i> Step 3 of 9:  </i></p>
                    <p> Many people who have tinnitus find it useful to use sound while practicing relaxation techniques. You might consider using a neutral sound, or a sound that is soothing for you.  </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <br />
                    <p><i> Step 4 of 9:  </i></p>
                    <p> Place one hand on your stomach and one hand on your chest. Take a normal breath in and notice which hand moves the most. Most likely it will be the hand on your chest. This shows that you tend to breathe shallow breaths from your chest. Now try to take a breath from your abdomen (stomach). You might feel like you are pushing your stomach out. That is how it feels when you are more relaxed and breathing more deeply.   </p>
