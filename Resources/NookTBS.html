            <p>Sleep is essential to good health. Sleep helps your body to repair itself, both physically and emotionally. Your tinnitus may seem worse when you are tired. When you get enough sleep, you are ready to handle problems and you won't get frustrated as easily.</p>

            <p> Before bed, avoid substances that can interfere with sleep.   </p>
            <p></p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                     Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime
                </li>
                <li>
                     Avoid nicotine before bedtime or when you wake up at night
                </li>
                <li>
                     Avoid alcohol just before bedtime. Alcohol can cause you to wake up during the night even though it might have helped you fall asleep.
                </li>
                <li>
                     Stop drinking beverages with caffeine at least 4-6 hours before bedtime
                </li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <b> Why?</b><br> <p>Alcohol may seem like it will help you sleep. However, research has shown that alcohol before bed can make you wake up later in the night. It is much better to have herbal tea, warm milk, or another soothing beverage before bed.  </p>
            <p></p>
            <p> A light snack can ease nighttime hunger but be careful to avoid large meals. Large meals before bed can make you feel uncomfortably full or cause heartburn or gas. These discomforts can keep you awake. Nicotine and caffeine are stimulants that can also keep you awake. </p>

             <p>Sleep behavior is teaching your body to associate the bed with sleep, not frustration.  </p>

            <ul type="disc" class="bullet-lists">

                  Go to bed only when sleepy

                <li>
                  If unable to fall asleep within 20 minutes, get out of bed and engage in a quiet activity. Return to bed when sleepy. <u>Note</u>: It is normal to wake up a few times during the night. Very few people sleep through the night without interruptions.
                </li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <p><b> Why?   </b></p>
            <p></p>
            <p> You can teach your body to associate the bed with sleep. If you eat, watch TV, and play video games while in bed you start to associate the bed with these wakeful activities. Then you tend to stay awake when you are in bed. If you associate your bed with sleep, then getting into bed will tell your body and mind that it is time to sleep. Then you are more likely to sleep when you are in bed.

              </ul>
                    <p> The body and brain adapt to a regular sleep schedule.  People who work swing shift or who travel a lot change their sleep and wake times often. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>This disrupts the biological clock. When your biological clock is disrupted your body tells you it's time to move around when you want to sleep. And when you want to be awake your body tells you it's time to sleep. Setting these sleep and wake times and sticking to them regardless of what is going on in your life will help you to sleep better.</p>

                     Light. Light naturally tells the brain it is time to wake up.  In our modern world, many things produce artificial light that can disturb sleep. TV, iPads, phones and electric lights are all culprits in keeping us awake. Limiting these light sources or wearing an eye mask to block the light can improve your sleep.    </p>

                <li>
                     Sound. Constant low level background sound can keep other sounds from waking you up. Sound can also be used in specific ways to manage reactions to tinnitus.

      <p>Often we have a lot of things to take care of before we go to bed.  Sometimes there is work, laundry or chores to do before morning. This can be very stimulating and cause our minds to continue processing things while we try to relax and settle down to sleep.  Therefore, these suggestions invite you to do something relaxing before bed to allow the mind to calm before you settle in for the night.<b>  </b>     </div>
